External API Integration

This project uses the RAWG Video Games Database API to display real game data such as titles, genres, release dates, and ratings.
The integration is done via JavaScript using fetch() requests to the RAWG API https://rawg.io/
The data is dynamically rendered on the website to make the game pages more realistic and informative.
